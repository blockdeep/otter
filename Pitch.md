## 🐋 What Is OTTER?

**OTTER** is a plug-and-play **governance framework for the Sui blockchain**.  
It empowers any Sui-based dApp to **launch, manage, and scale decentralized governance** — without needing deep Move expertise or weeks of dev time.

Governance shouldn’t be an afterthought. OTTER makes it effortless.

---

## 🌊 Why OTTER?

Sui is fast, scalable, and expressive — but governance is still a missing piece.  
There’s no **native standard** for proposals, voting, or execution.

OTTER solves this:

- ✅ Provides a reusable governance contract suite (written in Move)
- ✅ Handles proposal creation, voting, and on-chain execution
- ✅ Emits clean, indexable events for real-time frontends
- ✅ Includes frontend infra and a governance dashboard
- ✅ Supports storage refunds via **Walrus** to reduce costs

---

## 🧰 How It Works

At its core, OTTER offers:

### 🎛️ 1. **Governance System Object**
A smart contract that manages:
- Proposal lifecycles
- Voting power
- Finalization rules
- On-chain execution

### 📜 2. **Proposal Kinds**
A flexible enum (`ProposalKind`) that lets projects define what governance controls:
- Counter-based demos: `Increment`, `SetValue`
- Real-world usage: Treasury transfers, configuration updates, etc.

### 📡 3. **Indexable Events**
OTTER emits structured events like:
- `ProposalCreated`
- `VoteCast`
- `ProposalStatusChanged`
- `ProposalExecuted`

These allow the frontend to respond instantly and enable indexers to sync governance state across the Sui ecosystem.

## 💡 What Makes OTTER Different?

- **Generalized**: Works for any Sui dApp with minimal adaptation
- **Composable**: Supports different proposal logic for different contracts
- **Developer-Friendly**: Includes contract templates, CLI scripts, and full setup docs
- **User-Centric**: Offers a frontend to browse, vote, and manage proposals in one place

---

## 🧪 Technical Highlights

- Written in **Sui Move**
- Supports **dynamic field storage** for extensibility
- Uses **VecMap** to manage voters efficiently
- **Quorum logic**, **thresholds**, and **statuses** enforce voting rules on-chain
- Fully **event-driven**, enabling real-time syncing

---

<!-- ## 💸 Sustainable Model

OTTER is designed to be modular and monetizable:
- Setup fee for projects launching governance
- Optional subscription for analytics/API access
- Gas rebates on proposal execution
- Custom support for enterprise adoption -->

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap Snapshot

- ✅ MVP: Onboarding, core contracts, storage refunding
- ✅ Full frontend with DAO launcher, dashboards, and auto-onboarding tools
- 🧩 Plugin-based governance features like conviction voting, quadratic votes and further customization

---

## 🔚 Final Thought

**Governance is infrastructure.** And like bridges and roads, it needs to be dependable, extensible, and scalable.

OTTER delivers that for Sui.

Let the whales govern. 🐋
