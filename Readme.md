#  OTTER — Decentralized Governance on Sui

Welcome to **OTTER**, the governance framework built for the Sui blockchain.  
OTTER makes it easy for any Sui-based dApp to launch, manage, and scale decentralized governance — no complex setup required.

---

## 🌊 Why OTTER?

In the ocean of Web3 governance, dApps on Sui lack a native, unified solution. OTTER fills that gap by offering:

- A plug-and-play governance layer for any Sui dApp.
- Frictionless on-chain voting with real-time feedback.
- Walrus-based storage refunds for proposal cost optimization.
- A single interface to govern across the entire Sui ecosystem.

---

## 🔧 Core Features

- **Unified Governance Hub**: Discover and participate in proposals across all onboarded dApps.
- **Create & Vote on Proposals**: Easily launch proposals, cast votes (Yes/No/Abstain), and track results.
- **On-Chain Execution**: Execute governance-approved smart contract actions directly.
- **Storage Refunds via Walrus**: Failed proposals allow proposers to reclaim their storage cost.
- **Custom Governance Models**: Projects can configure quorum, voting thresholds, and execution logic.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Frontend (Coming Soon)
- A governance dashboard to:
  - View all dApp governance.
  - Create and manage proposals.
  - Vote and track proposal outcomes.

### Manual Onboarding (MVP Phase)
Due to the limitations of dynamic dispatch on Sui, onboarding is manual for now. 

#### Onboarding Flow:
1. Project Discovery & Outreach
2. Initial Contact & Demo with the OTTER team
3. Governance Fit Assessment
4. Onboarding Agreement (Paid)
5. Manual Setup of Governance Contracts + Walrus Storage
6. Integration Support (Frontend/API)
7. Live Launch of Governance

## 💸 Revenue Model

- **Setup Fee**: One-time payment for governance deployment and storage config.
<!-- - **Subscription Model**: Optional monthly/annual access to analytics and API suite.
- **Gas-Based Fees**: Optional cut from proposal execution or gas-based volume.
- **Custom Integration Support**: Billed for advanced needs. -->
