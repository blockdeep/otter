#  OTTER — Decentralized Governance on Sui

Welcome to **OTTER**, the governance framework built for the Sui blockchain.  
OTTER makes it easy for any Sui-based dApp to launch, manage, and scale decentralized governance — no complex setup required.

---

## 🌊 Why OTTER?

In the ocean of Web3 governance, dApps on Sui lack a native, unified solution. OTTER fills that gap by offering:

- A plug-and-play governance layer for any Sui dApp.
- Frictionless on-chain voting with real-time feedback.
- Walrus-based storage refunds for proposal cost optimization.
- A single interface to govern across the entire Sui ecosystem.

---

## 🔧 Core Features

- **Unified Governance Hub**: Discover and participate in proposals across all onboarded dApps.
- **Create & Vote on Proposals**: Easily launch proposals, cast votes (Yes/No/Abstain), and track results.
- **On-Chain Execution**: Execute governance-approved smart contract actions directly.
- **Storage Refunds via Walrus**: Failed proposals allow proposers to reclaim their storage cost.
- **Custom Governance Models**: Projects can configure quorum, voting thresholds, and execution logic.

## 🚀 Getting Started


### Frontend
- A governance dashboard to:
  - View all dApp governance.
  - Create and manage proposals.
  - Vote and track proposal outcomes.

~~### Manual Onboarding (MVP Phase)
Due to the limitations of dynamic dispatch on Sui, onboarding is manual for now.~~


### LAUNCH GOVERNANCE 
 - In the short while of the hackathon we've managed to build a contract creator for app contracts.
 - Create your own governance contract with three easy steps:
    1. Upload your App contract (in move language).
    2. Choose the functions you want to include in the governance contract.
    3. That's it! Our backend will create a governance contract for you which you can download and deploy!.

  - For steps on how to deploy the governance contract follow this [guide](./Deploy)
